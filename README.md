Files that run people.rit.edu/hxt1965

This website is essentially an online resume that I coded from scratch 
that demonstrates my skills in HTML and CSS. I created the icons in paint.io and implemented the design
myself. 
I'm currently working on a full blown expansion into a semi-blog but its taking a lot of time lmao.
